## What is Selpics?
Selpics is a platform used by photographers to create albums and send them to clients for photo selection.

## Gallery Summary
In the example screenshot, the photographer created an album with 33 photos and sent it to the client 'g173058@dac.unicamp.br', who selected the photos.

In the client selection, the chosen photos appear with the same names as at the time of upload.

## Extractor
The extractor opens the link provided in the 'Album URL', retrieves the names of the chosen photos, opens the selected directory in 'Photo directory', 
copies and places them in a 'Chosen' folder within the root directory. The photographer must enter their Email and Password for everything to proceed correctly. 
If everything goes well, in addition to the created folder, a list with the names of the chosen photos is displayed, along with a success message.
