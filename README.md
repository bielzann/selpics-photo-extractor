## Extractor
<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="justify">
      The extractor opens the link provided in the 'Album URL', retrieves the names of the chosen photos, opens the selected directory in 'Photo directory', 
      copies and places them in a 'Chosen' folder within the root directory. The photographer must enter their Email and Password for everything to proceed correctly. 
      If everything goes well, in addition to the created folder, a list with the names of the chosen photos is displayed, along with a success message.
